 # Kali NetHunter Installer

This [Kali NetHunter](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-mobile) installer is basically just a zip file generated by `build.py` from the folder layout contained here.

Follow the instructions below to create the installer zip.

All you have to do is flash it through **TWRP** for a complete Kali NetHunter environment and chroot on your device.

The boot image patching script is based on [LazyFlasher](https://github.com/jcadduono/lazyflasher)'s kernel-flasher branch.

<!--- About these files:

- `build.py` will create a one off image
- `prep-release.py` will create a bash script (`./build-<release>.sh`) to generate multiple images, each time calling `./build.py <...>` prep-release is used by the Kali developers for their quarterly releases and serve no other purpose --->

## Instructions

### Preparing the environment

Before building **anything**, you will need to initialize the [devices repository](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices).

The whole setup has been automated. As Kali NetHunter devices have an immense binary Git history, we suggest using shallow clone _(`--depth 1`)_, rather than **full history** when prompt:

```bash
./bootstrap.sh
```

_This will clone [Kali NetHunter Devices](https://gitlab.com/kalilinux/nethunter/build-scripts/kali-nethunter-devices) into `./devices/`_

### Build command examples

Example building for the **Nexus 5 (hammerhead)**:

```bash
./build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow
```

- - -

Building the **kernel only** _(useful for testing if kernel works)_:

```bash
./build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow -k
```

- - -

Building **without the kernel** _(useful for just updating apps)_:

```bash
./build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow -nk
```

- - -

Building with **adding a full chroot** _(add `kalifs-full.tar.xz` to `rootfs/[arch]/kalifs-full.tar.xz`):_

```bash
./build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow --rootfs full
```

- - -

Create a **release version**:

```bash
./build.py -d hammerhead --marshmallow --rootfs full --release 2021.3
```

- - -

Force **download all third party apps**:

```bash
./build.py --forcedown
```

- - -

Building the **uninstaller**:

```bash
./build.py --uninstaller
```

- - -

Show **help**:

```bash
./build.py -h
```
